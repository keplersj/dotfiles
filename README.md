# [Kepler](https://keplersj.com)'s Dotfiles

Like any good, [very online](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=very%20online), programmer in the 21st century I've been meaning to consolidate and share my [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments) on my GitHub. At long last I'll finally be consolidating my config across all of my environments in this repo.

## Installation

Use `chezmoi`'s configuration applier one-liner to apply this configuration to your environment:

```sh
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi)" -- init --apply keplersj
```
